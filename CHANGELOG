# Requirements Update (requirements will need to be reinstalled)
Update pillow requirement to 11.0.0
Update psutil requirement to 6.1.0
Update setuptools requirement to 75.2.0

# New Features
Added the `character` search option to the `imdb_search` builder

# Defaults
Fixed incorrect content rating mappings in various Default files
Fixes an issue where Prime Video overlays/collections would not be built when the `watch_region` is set to AU
Ratings Default file now fetches the rating during the Run, meaning users no longer have to rely on Plex's rating system or use the Mass Rating Update operations in order to get rating overlays.
Ratings Default file will now auto-pick the best image if one is not selected. For example, if `rating1: imdb` then the pre-configured `rating1_image` will be `imdb` out of the box without the user having to specify.

# Bug Fixes
