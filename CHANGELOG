This data will be more accurate and up-to-date now.

Trakt Builder `trakt_userlist` value `recommendations` removed and `favorites` added.
Mass Update operations now can be given a list of sources to fall back on when one fails including a manual source.
`mass_content_rating_update` has a new source `mdb_age_rating`
`mass_originally_available_update` has a new source `mdb_digital`
`plex` attributes `clean_bundles`, `empty_trash`, and `optimize` can now take any schedule options to be run only when desired.
