**We're so happy to finally have a dedicated blog where we can post longer-form content for all of our users**

We plan to use this blog to help us reach our users who don't follow us on Discord, which is where we have primarily posted updates and announcements.

We also want to use this space to showcase some of our incredible community-driven creations; collections, overlays and more! Keep your eyes peeled for more on this.

<!-- more -->

Our aim is for this blog to continue to grow as Kometa does, and we will provide running commentary on new features, announcements, tips & tricks and more!

We're always open to suggestions on how we can improve the blog, the best way to get in touch with us is via our [Discord Server](https://kometa.wiki/en/nightly/link/).

Stay tuned for more updates from the Kometa team!
