# Playlist Files Attributes

As playlists are not tied to one specific library and can combine media from multiple libraries, they require their own special [Playlist Files](../files/playlists.md) to work.

Within the [Config File](../config/overview.md), the `playlist_files` attribute specifies the [path type](../config/files.md#file-blocks) and path of the [Playlist Files](../files/playlists.md) that the user wants Kometa to act on.

**The libraries used in the playlist attribute `libraries` must be defined under the `libraries` attribute of the [Config File](../config/overview.md).**

```yaml
playlist_files:
  - file: config/playlists.yml
  - default: playlist
```

## Example

This example is an advanced version of the playlist mappings with accompanying library mappings:

```yaml
libraries:
  Movies:
    collection_files:
      - file: config/Movies.yml
      - default: imdb
      - default: studio
      - default: genre
      - default: actor
    operations:
      mass_critic_rating_update: tmdb
      split_duplicates: true
  TV Shows:
    collection_files:
      - file: config/TV Shows.yml
      - default: tmdb
      - default: network
    remove_overlays: false
    overlay_files:
      - file: config/Overlays.yml
playlist_files:
  - file: config/playlists.yml
  - default: playlist
```
