## Default Value Source

This is a reference showing the source of the data used in this Defaults File.

Nothing in this section is required for using the Defaults File, but it can be useful for understanding where the data comes from.

**Nothing in this section is directly useful for customizing this Defaults File.**

Nothing here is a code example for end user use. It all *looks* like code, since it is taken directly *from* the Kometa source code to ensure it is up-to-date and accurate, 
but it is not intended for end user use, and is expressed in a different format to the way you would customize the defaults via Template Variables.

    To learn how to customize any Defaults File using Template Variables see the [Defaults Usage Guide](./../../../defaults/guide).
    
    Each Defaults File has its own set of Template Variables, which are used to control the behavior of that default.
    The Template Variables for this file can be found [here](#template-variables).

??? question "I want to know what's behind the defaults"

    The lists provided here are for reference to show what values will be in use if no customization is done.
