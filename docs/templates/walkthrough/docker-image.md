#### Important note on Docker images

This tutorial uses the official image, and you should, too. Don't change `kometateam/kometa` to the `linuxserver.io` image or any other. 
Other images may have [idiosyncrasies](./../../kometa/install/images.md) that will prevent this walkthrough from working. 
The official image *will* behave exactly as documented below. Others very possibly won't.

The great thing about Docker is that all the setup you'd have to do to run Kometa is already done inside the docker image.
