# PMM Explanations, Guides & Recipes

This page outlines the explanations, guides and recipes that will help you understand certain aspects of PMM that may not be easily understood without expanded context or examples that would be difficult to provide in the standard wiki pages.

Special credit to [Chazlarson](https://github.com/chazlarson) for the time and effort he has spent developing a lot of these guides.

## Explanations

The below guides and recipes have been created to assist users with various aspects of Plex Meta Managers and its companion scripts.

- [Plex Ratings Explained](ratings.md)
- [Scheduling PMM Runs Guide](scheduling.md)
- [Image Asset Directory Guide](assets.md)
- [Log Files](../logs.md)

## Guides

A lot of these guides are stored on Google Drive as using the traditional wiki pages would make the formatting difficult to understand.
