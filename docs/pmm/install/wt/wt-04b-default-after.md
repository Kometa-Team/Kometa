Depending on the size of the library, this may take a while.

As it builds the collections, you should see a fair amount of logging about which movies are being added and which ones aren’t found.  Once it completes, go to Plex, go to your Movies library, and click “Collections” at the top.

On my test library, this created four collections.  You may see fewer depending on what specific movies are in that library.

Perhaps you can do everything you want in terms of collections [award collections, actor collections, genre collections, franchise collections, etc] with the defaults.  You can investigate what they can provide under the "Defaults" heading at the top of this wiki.
