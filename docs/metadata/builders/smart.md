# Smart Builders

Smart Builders allow Plex Meta Manager to create Smart Collections in two different ways.

** Smart Builders do not currently work with Playlists **

## Smart Label

A Smart Label Collection is a smart collection that grabs every item with a specific label generated by the program. That label is added to all the items the Collection Builders find instead of being added to a normal collection. 

To make a collection a Smart Label Collection, the `smart_label` attribute must added to the collection definition. It functions in two different ways:

1. Define the sort using the Movies/Shows column of the [Sorts Table](#sort-options) below along with any other builder to make that collection a Smart Label Collection.
    ```yaml
    collections:
      Marvel Cinematic Universe:
        trakt_list: https://trakt.tv/users/jawann2002/lists/marvel-cinematic-universe-movies?sort=rank,asc
        smart_label: release.desc
    ```

2. Provide a whole `smart_filter` to determine exactly how the smart collection should be built, ensuring to include `label: <<smart_label>>`, which will link it to the collection labels.
    ```yaml
    collections:
      Unplayed Marvel Cinematic Universe:
        trakt_list: https://trakt.tv/users/jawann2002/lists/marvel-cinematic-universe-movies?sort=rank,asc
        smart_label:
          sort_by: release.desc
          all:
            label: <<smart_label>>
            unplayed: True
    ```

This is extremely useful because smart collections don't follow normal show/hide rules and can eliminate the need to have [Plex Collectionless](plex.md#plex-collectionless) when used correctly. To fix the issue described in [Plex Collectionless](plex.md#plex-collectionless) you would make `Marvel Cinematic Universe` a Smart Label Collection and all other Marvel collection just normal collections, and they will show/hide all the movie properly.

To have the Smart Label Collections to eliminate Plex Collectionless you have to go all in on using them. A good rule of thumb to make sure this works correctly is that every item in your library should have a max of one non-smart collection.

Reach out on the [Plex Meta Manager Discord](https://discord.gg/TsdpsFYqqm) or in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/discussions) for help if you're having any issues getting this to work properly.

## Smart Filter

Uses Plex's [Advanced Filters](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201273953-collections/) to create a smart collection based on the filter parameters provided.

Any Advanced Filter made using the Plex UI should be able to be recreated using `smart_filter`. If you're having trouble getting `smart_filter` to work correctly, build the collection you want inside of Plex's Advanced Filters and take a screenshot of the parameters in the Plex UI and post it in either the [Discussions](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/discussions) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/TsdpsFYqqm), and I'll do my best to help you. 

like Plex's [Advanced Filters](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201273953-collections/) you have to start each filter with either `any` or `all` as a base. You can only have one base attribute and all filter attributes must be under the base.

Inside the base attribute you can use any filter below or nest more `any` or `all`. You can have as many nested `any` or `all` next to each other as you want. If using multiple `any` or `all` you will have to do so in the form of a list.  

**Note: To search by `season`, `episode`, `album`, or `track` you must use the `collection_level` [Detail](../details/metadata) to change the type of items the collection holds.**

There are a couple other attributes you can have at the top level only along with the base attribute are:

## Special Attributes

## Filters

There are three fields per filter option when using Plex's Advanced Filters in the Web UI.

1. **Attribute:** What attribute you wish to filter.
2. **Modifier:** Which modifier to use.
3. **Value:** Actual value to filter.

**Example:** `Attribute.Modifier: Value`

## String Filters

String filters can be used with either no modifier or with `.not`, `.is`, `.isnot`, `.begins`, or `.ends`.

String filter can take multiple values **only as a list**.

### String Modifiers

| String Modifier | Description                                                                    | Plex Web UI Display |
|:----------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------:|
| No Modifier     | Matches every item where the attribute contains the given string               |     `contains`      |
| `.not`          | Matches every item where the attribute does not contain the given string       | `does not contain`  |
| `.is`           | Matches every item where the attribute exactly matches the given string        |        `is`         |
| `.isnot`        | Matches every item where the attribute does not exactly match the given string |      `is not`       |
| `.begins`       | Matches every item where the attribute begins with the given string            |    `begins with`    |
| `.ends`         | Matches every item where the attribute ends with the given string              |     `ends with`     |

If you specify TMDb Person ID's using the Detail `tmdb_person` and then tell either `actor`, `director`, `producer`, or `writer` to add `tmdb`, the script will translate the TMDb Person IDs into their names and run the filter on those names.

```yaml
collections:
  Robin Williams:
    smart_filter:
      all:
        actor: tmdb
    tmdb_person: 2157
```
```yaml
collections:
  Steven Spielberg:
    smart_filter:
      all:
        director: tmdb
    tmdb_person: https://www.themoviedb.org/person/488-steven-spielberg
```
```yaml
collections:
  Quentin Tarantino:
    smart_filter:
      any:
        actor: tmdb
        director: tmdb
        producer: tmdb
        writer: tmdb
    tmdb_person: 138
