# Overlays Showcase

This page is designed to show the art of the possible when using Overlays within Kometa.

Each showcased photo has been confirmed to be fully functional with Kometa v1.19.0. We cannot guarantee functionality beyond that version.

## Example 1

=== "Example 1"

    ![Overlay Showcase 1](overlay-showcase1.jpg){width="600" align=left loading=lazy }
    
    This example shows a minimalistic Overlay application with the resolution, audio codec and video format on display.

    This example uses three Kometa Default Overlay files: [Resolution](../defaults/overlays/resolution.md), [Audio Codec](../defaults/overlays/audio_codec.md) and [Video Format](../defaults/overlays/video_format.md).

    Resolution is used to identify if the movie is 4K for example, and also highlights if a movie is Dolby Vision or HDR.

    Audio Codec is used to identify what format the audio is in (such as Dolby Digital or Dolby ATMOS)

    Video Format is used to identify the source of a file (such as a DVD rip or a WEB rip)

    This code belongs in config.yml

    ```yml
    libraries:
      Movies:
        overlay_files:
        - default: resolution
        - default: audio_codec
        - default: video_format
    ```

    **Replace `Movies` with the name of your library**

## Example 2

=== "Example 2"

    ![Overlay Showcase 2](overlay-showcase2.jpg){width="600" align=left loading=lazy }
    
    This example shows a minimalistic Overlay application with the ratings and ribbon of the movie.

    This example uses two Kometa Default Overlay files: [Ratings](../defaults/overlays/ratings.md) and [Ribbon](../defaults/overlays/ribbon.md).

    Ratings are set to show the Rotten Tomatoes Audience & Critic scores, as well as the IMDb score.

    Custom fonts have been used for the ratings which can be sourced in [bullmoose20's repository](https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Community-Configs/tree/master/bullmoose20) within `fonts.zip`

    A [Library Operation](../config/operations.md#mass-star-rating-update) is used to place the IMDb rating into the user rating slot, as can be seen in the code example.

            rating2_horizontal_offset: 250
            rating3_horizontal_offset: 470
        - default: ribbon
        operations:
          mass_user_rating_update: imdb
    ```

    **Replace `Movies` with the name of your library** and **Set the font location to wherever you place them**


## Example 3

=== "Example 3"

    ![Overlay Showcase 3](overlay-showcase3.jpg){width="600" align=left loading=lazy }
    
    This example shows a minimalistic Overlay application with the ratings applied at the bottom of the poster

    This example uses two Kometa Default Overlay files: [Ratings](../defaults/overlays/ratings.md) and [Runtimes](../defaults/overlays/runtimes.md).

    Ratings are set to show the TMDb, Trakt and IMDb ratings, which have been set using [Library Operations](../config/operations.md#mass-star-rating-update)

    The runtimes overlay is modified to show no text, but to instead produce the black bar which the ratigns sit on top of.
