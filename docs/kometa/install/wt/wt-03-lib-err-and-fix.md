I’ve removed some of the lines for space, but have left the important bits:

```

You can see there that Kometa found its config file, was able to connect to TMDb, was able to connect to Plex, and then failed trying to read the “Movies-NOSUCHLIBRARY" library, which of course doesn’t exist.

Open the config file again and change "Movies-NOSUCHLIBRARY" to reflect *your own* Movie library in Plex.

Say my Movies library is called “All The Movies", so mine looks like this:

```yaml
libraries:
  All The Movies:                            ## <<< CHANGE THIS LINE
    collection_files:
      - default: basic               # This is a file within the defaults folder in the Repository
      - default: imdb                # This is a file within the defaults folder in the Repository
      # see the wiki for how to use local files, folders, URLs, or files from git
```

At this point, the top bit of your config file should look like this:

```yaml
libraries:
  THE_NAME_OF_YOUR_MOVIE_LIBRARY:         ## <<< CHANGE THIS LINE
    collection_files:
      - default: basic               # This is a file within the defaults folder in the Repository
      - default: imdb                # This is a file within the defaults folder in the Repository
      # see the wiki for how to use local files, folders, URLs, or files from git
playlist_files:
  - default: playlist                # This is a file within Kometa's defaults folder
  # see the wiki for how to use local files, folders, URLs, or files from git
```

Where `THE_NAME_OF_YOUR_MOVIE_LIBRARY` has been replaced by the name of your movie library as shown in Plex ["All The Movies" here]:
