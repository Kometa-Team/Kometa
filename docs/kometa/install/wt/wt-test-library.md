While going through this process, Kometa is going to load the movies in your library, create some collections, and apply some overlays.  If you have a large library, this will be very time-consuming.

For learning and testing, you would be well-advised to create a small test library of a reasonable size, where reasonable it probably below a thousand.

The author has a small library of 10 movies that is used for fast tests.

For best results *with this walkthrough*, your test library will contain:

 - At least two comedy movies released since 2012.
 - At least two movies from the [IMDB top 250](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/).
 - At least two movies from [IMDB's Popular list](https://www.imdb.com/chart/moviemeter).
 - At least two movies from [IMDB's Lowest Rated](https://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom).
 - A couple different resolutions among the movies.

That will ensure there's something to go into each of the example collections that will be created.

The advantage of the small test library is that it will reduce the time needed to see results.  Running some of these default collections against a library of a few thousand movies can take hours, and for iterative testing it's useful to have something that will run in a few minutes or seconds.

You can set up a test library like this using symlinks without copying files.
