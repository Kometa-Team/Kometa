# Log files and where to find them

### Locating Log Files

The meta.log file can be found within the `logs` folder of your Kometa config folder [right next to `config.yml`].

`meta.log` is the most recent run of Kometa, `meta.log.1` is the previous run, `meta.log.2` is the run before that, so on and so forth.

As new log files are created, the old ones get a numeric suffix added: `meta.log.1`. **The most recent is always the one without a number at the end.**

### Providing Log Files on Discord

You can drag-and-drop your meta.log file directly into [Discord](https://kometa.wiki/en/latest/discord/), you do not need to upload it to a third-party site unless it exceeds the 50mb size limit.

Please DO NOT manually extract, copy and paste text from your log files directly into Discord as the formatting can be difficult to read and can often redact parts of the log file that are important for full context.

### Basic Log File Troubleshooting

Wondering how to troubleshoot Kometa and how to read through the meta.log?

**Using a text editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is recommended**

In all cases, the first step is to open the [`meta.log`](#locating-log-files) with your text editor and perform these steps:

1. Check that you are running the latest [`version`](#checking-kometa-version) of your branch. Your current version can be found in the `meta.log` file either below the Kometa ASCII art, or at the end of the run. If you are not on the latest version of your branch, you will see `Newest Version: X.X.X` below this. Ensure you [`upgrade`](install/local.md#i-want-to-update-to-the-latest-version-of-kometa) to the latest version of Kometa.
2. When scanning your meta.log file, search for `[CRITICAL]` items first as these will definitely need to be fixed
3. Scan your meta.log file for `[ERROR]` and make a note of the content of the full line to start your search below on how to resolve

### Checking Kometa Version

Checking the version: You will find that in your [`meta.log`](#locating-log-files) around the 8th-10th line and will look something like this:

```
|                                 |
|     Version: 1.19.1-develop10   |
|=================================|
```

If you are not on the latest version of your branch, you will see Newest Version: X.X.X below this. Ensure you upgrade to the latest version of Kometa.

```
|                                       |
|     Version: 1.19.1-develop10         |
|     Newest Version: 1.19.1-develop20  |
|=======================================|
```

### Understanding Log File Event Types

There are five main event types that you need to be aware of when understanding the log files, detailed below:

| Type       | Short Info            | Description                                                              | Recommendation                                                                                        |
|:-----------|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `INFO`     | Information log       | Informational message that does not require much attention               | No action required                                                                                    |
| `DEBUG`    | Debug Log             | Debug log message that does not require much attention                   | No action required                                                                                    |
| `WARNING`  | Warning Log           | Warning message that may require your attention                          | Read the warning and determine if this is something you need to take action on or not                 |
| `ERROR`    | Error Log             | Error message that in MOST cases requires action on your part to resolve | Read the error message, look for the message below and try recommendations                            |
| `CRITICAL` | Critical Log          | Critical message requiring you to fix it for Kometa to run properly         | Read the critical message and take appropriate action. look for message below and try recommendations |

### Other Troubleshooting Examples

The Log files will contain a great deal of detail about what exactly is happening and why.  Generally speaking, if you're having a problem with Kometa the answer will be found here.  These logs can of course be quite technical, but often the error can be relatively clear:

Something's missing from the format of the file:

```
| Loading Collection File: config/TV Shows.yml                                                         |
|                                                                                                    |
| YAML Error: metadata, collections, or dynamic_collections attribute is required                    |
```

The problem in that case was:

```yaml
templates:
  Collection:
    cache_builders: 30
    sync_mode: sync
    sort_title: ZZZ-<<source>>-<<collection_name>>

collections:   <<< THIS LINE WAS MISSING
  Cached for 30 Days:
    template: {name: Collection, source: Looper}
    summary: ""
    trakt_list:
      - https://trakt.tv/users/kesleyalfa/lists/year-2011
```

YAML doesn't allow duplicate keys:

```
| Loading Collection File: config/Anime.yml                                                            |
|                                                                                                    |
| YAML Error: while constructing a mapping
|   in "<unicode string>", line 27, column 5:
|         mal_favorite: 50
|         ^ (line: 27)
| found duplicate key "collection_order" with value "custom" (original value: "custom")
|   in "<unicode string>", line 32, column 5:
|         collection_order: custom
|         ^ (line: 32)
```

The problem there was something like this:

```yaml
templates:
  Collection:
    cache_builders: 30
    sync_mode: sync
    sort_title: ZZZ-<<source>>-<<collection_name>>

collections:   <<< THIS LINE WAS MISSING
  Cached for 30 Days:
    template: {name: Collection, source: Looper}
    collection_order: custom                         <<<<  THIS KEY
    summary: ""
    collection_order: custom                         <<<<  DUPLICATED HERE
    trakt_list:
      - https://trakt.tv/users/kesleyalfa/lists/year-2011
```

File is not where Kometa expects it:

```
| Loading Collection File: config/Movies.yml                                                           |
| YAML Error: File Error: File does not exist /Users/Lucky/Kometa/config/Movies.yml       |
```
