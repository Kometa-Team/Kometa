I’ve removed some of the lines for space, but have left the important bits:

You can see there that PMM found its config file, was able to connect to TMDb, was able to connect to Plex, and then failed trying to read the “Movies-NOSUCHLIBRARY" library, which of course doesn’t exist.

Open the config file again and change "Movies-NOSUCHLIBRARY" to reflect *your own* Movie library in Plex.  Then delete all but the first line under the "metadata_path” heading.  A few of them will create sets of collections, and we just want to create a few as examples.

My Movies library is called “Main Movies", so mine looks like this:

```yaml
libraries:
  Main Movies:                            ## <<< CHANGE THIS LINE
    metadata_path:
      - file: config/Movies.yml
```
